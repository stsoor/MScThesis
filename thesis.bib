	abstract = {Sets comprise a generic data model that has been used in a variety of data analysis problems. Such problems involve analysing and visualizing set relations between multiple sets defined over the same collection of elements. However, visualizing sets is a non-trivial problem due to the large number of possible relations between them. We provide a systematic overview of state-of-the-art techniques for visualizing different kinds of set relations. We classify these techniques into six main categories according to the visual representations they use and the tasks they support. We compare the categories to provide guidance for choosing an appropriate technique for a given problem. Finally, we identify challenges in this area that need further research and propose possible directions to address these challenges. Further resources on set visualization are available at http://www.setviz.net.},

Starting with an abstract description of the diagram, we define the dual graph G and reason with the properties of this graph to build a planar representation of the X1,...,Xn.

Syntactic constraints called wellformedness conditions (WFCs) are often imposed with the intention of reducing comprehension errors, but there is little supporting empirical evidence that they have the desired effect. We report on experiments which support the theory that the WFCs are generally beneficial for novice user comprehension, but we discover that violating some individual WFCs, such as concurrency, can be beneficial. Furthermore, we examine a prioritisation of the WFCs, derived from the user comprehension results, which could be used to prioritise theoretical work on generation problems or to assist in the provision of a choice of a diagram to display to users, for instance. We have used similar materials to our previous ‘preference study’ for cross comparison purposes. This accumulation of work has motivated the development of a model of the user comprehension with the aim of more closely linking theoretical and empirical works examining effective notation design, general approaches to displaying notations and interacting with notations."

They facilitate set analysis, as humans tend to perceive distinct regions when closed curves are drawn on a plane. However, current automatic methods often produce diagrams with irregular, non-smooth curves that are not easily distinguishable. Other methods restrict the shape of the curve to for instance a circle, but such methods cannot draw an Euler diagram with exactly the required curve intersections for any set relations. In this paper, we present eulerForce, as the first method to adopt a force-directed approach to improve the layout and the curves of Euler diagrams generated by current methods. The layouts are improved in quick time. Our evaluation of eulerForce indicates the benefits of a force-directed approach to generate comprehensible Euler diagrams for any set relations in relatively fast time."

	abstract="Euler diagrams are often used for visualizing data collected into sets. However, there is a significant lack of guidance regarding graphical choices for Euler diagram layout. To address this deficiency, this paper asks the question `does the shape of a closed curve affect a user's comprehension of an Euler diagram?' By empirical study, we establish that curve shape does indeed impact on understandability. Our analysis of performance data indicates that circles perform best, followed by squares, with ellipses and rectangles jointly performing worst. We conclude that, where possible, circles should be used to draw effective Euler diagrams. Further, the ability to discriminate curves from zones and the symmetry of the curve shapes is argued to be important. We utilize perceptual theory to explain these results. As a consequence of this research, improved diagram layout decisions can be made for Euler diagrams whether they are manually or automatically drawn.",

These categories, together with information about when categories share some datum, can be turned into a succinct diagram description from which an Euler diagram can be generated. Closed curves represent the categories and the relationships between the curves (such as containment) correspond to relationships between the categories (such as subset). A range of automated Euler diagram drawing methods have been proposed but they often produce diagrams that are aesthetically unpleasing, can be computationally complex and most of them cannot draw a diagram for some (often many) given collections of categories. One such method is capable of drawing aesthetically pleasing Euler diagrams, using only circles, and is computationally efficient (being of polynomial time complexity) but it applies to a very restricted subset of collections of categorized data. This paper substantially extends that method so it can always draw an Euler diagram, that is it applies to all collections of categorized data. In particular, we identify a class of diagram descriptions that can be drawn with circles, generalizing previous work. For diagram descriptions outside of this class, we define transformations that can be used to turn them into descriptions inside the ‘drawable with circles' class. We demonstrate how such transformations can be done in a general, a process during which many choices must be made. Further, we provide strategies for making particular choices which ensure desirable properties, such as curve containment, are preserved. We have provided a software implementation of the drawing method, which is freely available from www.eulerdiagrams.com/inductivecircles.htm."

Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems is the book that initiated this field of study, presenting the theoretical foundations and exploring applications. In its most familiar form, adaptation is a biological process, whereby organisms evolve by rearranging genetic material to survive in environments confronting them. In this now classic work, Holland presents a mathematical model that allows for the nonlinearity of such complex interactions. He demonstrates the model's universality by applying it to economics, physiological psychology, game theory, and artificial intelligence and then outlines the way in which this approach modifies the traditional views of mathematical genetics. Initially applying his concepts to simply defined artificial systems with limited numbers of parameters, Holland goes on to explore their use in the study of a wide range of complex, naturally occuring processes, concentrating on systems having multiple factors that interact in nonlinear ways. Along the way he accounts for major effects of coadaptation and coevolution: the emergence of building blocks, or schemata, that are recombined and passed on to succeeding generations to provide, innovations and improvements. John H. Holland is Professor of Psychology and Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Michigan. He is also Maxwell Professor at the Santa Fe Institute and isDirector of the University of Michigan/Santa Fe Institute Advanced Research Program.}

We also give an application to the distribution of eigenvalues of Hecke operators acting on weight 2 cusp forms for certain congruence subgroups.},

	abstract = {The celebrated Cheeger's Inequality [AM85,a86] establishes a bound on the expansion of a graph via its spectrum. This inequality is central to a rich spectral theory of graphs, based on studying the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix (and other related matrices) of graphs. It has remained open to define a suitable spectral model for hypergraphs whose spectra can be used to estimate various combinatorial properties of the hypergraph. In this paper we introduce a new hypergraph Laplacian operator generalizing the Laplacian matrix of graphs. Our operator can be viewed as the gradient operator applied to a certain natural quadratic form for hypergraphs. We show that various hypergraph parameters (for e.g. expansion, diameter, etc) can be bounded using this operator's eigenvalues. We study the heat diffusion process associated with this Laplacian operator, and bound its parameters in terms of its spectra. All our results are generalizations of the corresponding results for graphs.We show that there can be no linear operator for hypergraphs whose spectra captures hypergraph expansion in a Cheeger-like manner. Our Laplacian operator is non-linear, and thus computing its eigenvalues exactly is intractable. For any k, we give a polynomial time algorithm to compute an approximation to the kth smallest eigenvalue of the operator. We show that this approximation factor is optimal under the SSE hypothesis (introduced by [RS10]) for constant values of k.Finally, using the factor preserving reduction from vertex expansion in graphs to hypergraph expansion, we show that all our results for hypergraphs extend to vertex expansion in graphs.},

	abstract = {The celebrated Cheeger’s Inequality (Alon and Milman 1985; Alon 1986) establishes a bound on the edge expansion of a graph via its spectrum. This inequality is central to a rich spectral theory of graphs, based on studying the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix (and other related matrices) of graphs. It has remained open to define a suitable spectral model for hypergraphs whose spectra can be used to estimate various combinatorial properties of the hypergraph.In this article, we introduce a new hypergraph Laplacian operator generalizing the Laplacian matrix of graphs. In particular, the operator is induced by a diffusion process on the hypergraph, such that within each hyperedge, measure flows from vertices having maximum weighted measure to those having minimum. Since the operator is nonlinear, we have to exploit other properties of the diffusion process to recover the Cheeger’s Inequality that relates hyperedge expansion with the “second eigenvalue” of the resulting Laplacian. However, we show that higher-order spectral properties cannot hold in general using the current framework.Since higher-order spectral properties do not hold for the Laplacian operator, we instead use the concept of procedural minimizers to consider higher-order Cheeger-like inequalities. For any k ∈ N, we give a polynomial-time algorithm to compute an O(log r)-approximation to the kth procedural minimizer, where r is the maximum cardinality of a hyperedge. We show that this approximation factor is optimal under the SSE hypothesis (introduced by Raghavendra and Steurer (2010)) for constant values of k.Moreover, using the factor-preserving reduction from vertex expansion in graphs to hypergraph expansion, we show that all our results for hypergraphs extend to vertex expansion in graphs.},

	abstractNote={&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we present a hypergraph neural networks (HGNN) framework for data representation learning, which can encode high-order data correlation in a hypergraph structure. Confronting the challenges of learning representation for complex data in real practice, we propose to incorporate such data structure in a hypergraph, which is more flexible on data modeling, especially when dealing with complex data. In this method, a hyperedge convolution operation is designed to handle the data correlation during representation learning. In this way, traditional hypergraph learning procedure can be conducted using hyperedge convolution operations efficiently. HGNN is able to learn the hidden layer representation considering the high-order data structure, which is a general framework considering the complex data correlations. We have conducted experiments on citation network classification and visual object recognition tasks and compared HGNN with graph convolutional networks and other traditional methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed HGNN method outperforms recent state-of-theart methods. We can also reveal from the results that the proposed HGNN is superior when dealing with multi-modal data compared with existing methods.&lt;/p&gt;},
